# Exploratory Data Analysis of PJM's Interconnection Queue (Transition Cycle 1)

The project included an exploratory data analysis and evaluation of PJM's Interconnection Queue and Study process.

## Background:
- PJM implemented a transition from a serial study approach of each project to a cluster study approach for New Service Requests entering the PJM interconnection process.
- During this transition, PJM needed to analyze the first cluster of projects which had applied for interconnection but had not yet completed the serial study process.  
- Subsequently, PJM conducted load flow analyses to determine whether active AE1-AG1 queued projects would be eligible for the Expedited Process or be reprioritized to Transition Cycle 1 (TC1).
- The projects that were analyzed by PJM for Transition Cycle 1 (TC1) are the subject of this analysis.

## Objective:
The objective of the project was to use Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights into PJM's current cluster study projects.  The evaluation looks at the breakdown of projects by utility, location, generation technology, interconnection cost and MW capacities.
